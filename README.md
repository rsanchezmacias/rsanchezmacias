## Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

After graduating from UC Merced and working a full-time position for some time, I decided to create a new GitHub profile to focus on personal projects. You can still find my other profile [rsanchez-macias](https://github.com/rsanchez-macias), which contains school projects written mostly in Java or C++.
